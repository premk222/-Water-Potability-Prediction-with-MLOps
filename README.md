# Water Potability Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts the potability of water using various machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline with **DVC (Data Version Control)**, **MLFlow** for experiment and model tracking, and a **Cookiecutter** template to maintain the structure of the project.

## Key Features

- **DVC Pipelines**: Used for managing data, creating reproducible pipelines, and versioning datasets.
- **Cookiecutter Template**: Ensures a well-structured and scalable project layout.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Powered by **MLFlow**, tracking model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to ensure experiment reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning**: Logging and managing different model versions, facilitating deployment with MLFlow's model registry.


## Data and Features
- **Input Data**: The dataset includes features such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, and others relevant to water quality.
- **Target Variable**: `Potability` - A binary label indicating whether water is potable (1) or not (0).

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:


## Project Structure

The project follows the Cookiecutter data science template:
